## HTML Day 1

[Week 1 Website](https://codecrew-codeschool.github.io/Week1_HTML_lessons_202508/)

We created the index.html file, defined the html boilerplate, and used basic html elements to strucutre a simple web page. 

The elements we defined were:
- head
- body
- meta
- title
- p
- h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6
- ordered lists
- unordered lists
- a
- img

## HTML DAY 2 

Our html page evolved to add tables to it used table elements and discussed nesting html elements on pages:
- th
- tr
- td

We also discussed wireframes, and created a second page in which we chose a website, created a wireframe of its content, and updated the site with a second page that mocks up the wireframe in html.
